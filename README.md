# Road to LLM

A learning roadmap from the [tensor][1] to [large language models (LLMs)][2].

Inspired by [fromthetensor][3] and [tinygrad][4].

## Quickstart Guide

Setting up a [virtual environment][5] is highly recommended.

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Roadmap

- [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2015)][10]
- [Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (2020)][11]

### Section 3: Language

- [Attention Is All You Need (2017)][12]
- [Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners (2019)][13]
- [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding(2019)][14]

### Section 4: SOTA
